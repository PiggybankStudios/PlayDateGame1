# Playdate Game 1
A simple test game for the Play Date designed to be similar to [Pig Engine](https://www.siltutorials.com/pigengine). It uses [GyLib](https://github.com/PiggybankStudios/gylib) as the main utility library. It's built using a single build.bat that expects the MSVC compiler form VS 2022 to be installed.
